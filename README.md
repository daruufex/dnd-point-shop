# D&D Point Shop

Another D&D 5th edition point-buy digital helper, made with ❤️ using React and Tailwind.

## Future updates

Right now, the point-buy system is not configurable. I intend to make it so. For now, it uses the standard 5th edition point buy ruling (15 is the maximum attribute score without ancestry bonuses, 8 is the minimum attribute score, and the total available points are 27).
